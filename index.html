                  There won't be anything there unless you're using IE11 (but who does that nowadays?). If you want to see the script in action, simply change <code>11</code> to <code>-1</code> on line 22 of main.es6 (while <code>gulp</code> is running.
                  Generally speaking I've only touched this since dependabot raised concerns about the security of the packages used. It's no longer required, but I'm leaving it here for posterity after making sure it's safe.
